this is intended to provide context on my priorities / habits of thought:
- it needs to work across operating systems
- You can't depend on having pro features
- avoid admin where possible
- as portable as practical
- audit context means I need to be able to reproduce exactly
- "run this command" preferable to a confluence page of screenshots
:::

## How do I... {background-color="#333399"}

::: incremental
-   upgrade the version of R I'm using for this project?
-   know which package versions I'm using for this project?
-   move this project from one machine to another?
:::

::: notes
We're extending the lessons from Day 1 to think about what it means to work with R projects over time.
That means that in addition to wanting our individual projects to flow smoothly, we also want to strategize about how to manage different versions of the language, different package versions, and different execution contexts.
Working on an old project on a new computer is a lot like trying to put an app into production.

::: notes
The best way to become more comfortable with installing things is to practice in an environment you can throw away
- the windows sandbox lets you test in an environment on your machine that won't affect your computer
  - enabling it is outside the scope of this course
- for linux users, the easiest thing to do is stand up a small VPS
- I don't know of a good safe way to test mac environments

# mental model

# installing R {background-color="#333399"}

## "software managers"

package managers

software whose job it is to install other software

windows: **scoop**, chocolatey, winget  
macOS: **homebrew**  
linux: **homebrew**, apt, yum, zypper  

## ⚠️

Avoid installing your language with a package manager

:::{.notes}
You want to avoid having the language version your projects are using changed out from you unexpectedly
Tools for freezing installations with your package manager are not consistently effective
Other software that you install with your package manager may expect that package manager to be running the latest
Idiosyncracies of your language will be better understood by a dedicated tool
:::


## clickOps

![](img/installing-R.png)

## rig

https://github.com/r-lib/rig/

## language managers

using your package manager, install a language manager


::: {.panel-tabset}

### windows

`scoop install rig`

### *nix

`brew install rig`

:::

<small> 
pyenv  
nvm  
</small>

::: {.notes}
- many language managers are often written in some language other than the one they are responsible for managing
:::

## language versions

using your language manager, install a language version:

```
❯ rig install --help
rig-add

DESCRIPTION:
    Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
    It keeps the already installed R versions, except versions within the
    same minor branch, see below.

EXAMPLES:
    # Add the latest release
    rig add release

    # Install specific version
    rig add 4.1.2

    # Install latest version within a minor branch
    rig add 4.1

```

::: {.notes}
if you're running a distribution of linux that rig doesn't support:
- https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r/

if no pre-compiled binary of rig is available:
- https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r-source/
:::

## environment managers

using your desired version of the language, install an environment manager:

:::{.r-fit-text}
`install.packages("renv")`
:::

## project

using your environment manager, install your project's dependencies:

## activity {.smaller}

::: question


1. read the [rig FAQ](https://github.com/r-lib/rig#-faq), or the [rswitch guide](https://rud.is/rswitch/guide/)


1. install a different major/minor version of R

    - <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>
    
    - <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/>


1. install rig

    - use rig to install a different major or minor version of R
  
    - open RStudio with that newly installed R version

- accessing things once they're in the R environ

`Sys.getenv()`

:::{.notes}
the keys have already been burned, don't worry
:::

## `.Rprofile`

interactive helpers that run in every session

## what to put in `.Rprofile`

- Set a default CRAN mirror 
- Write a welcome message 
- Customize R prompt 
- Selectively change (but be careful) 
  - Options, screen width, numeric display 
  - Load frequently used interactive packages 
  - Aliases / shortcuts for frequently used functions
  
- you don't typically share rprofiles
  
::: {.notes}
rlrang::entrace so base errors get better context?

## why shouldn't these go in `.Rprofile`?

- Binary
- Source

## Binary

- compiled ahead of time
- only R is needed to install

## renv

![](img/renv.png)

::: {.notes}
renv has a number of tools that are helpful for adopting a project-based workflow:
- lockfile records what packages you use and where you instaled them from
- `renv::install()` can handle installation from remote sources, local sources, package versions, bioconductor, rspm
- per-project library isolation with global package cache makes it easy to install experimental versions of packages and then roll back to a stable release if it doesn't work out
:::

## `renv::init()`

```{.r code-line-numbers="|2|4"}
.libPaths()
renv::init()
.libPaths()
renv::deactivate()
.libPaths()
```

::: {.notes}
run `.libPaths()` to see what your default package libraries are
initialize an renv--you'll see that the environment is now local to the project
note the .Rprofile that gets placed into your project, which runs an R script in `renv/activate.R`
deactivate the environment and check libPaths() again--it should be back to normal
:::

## `renv.lock`

```{.json}
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.1.2",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",

by default, identifies dependencies of your code
for example: usethis doesn't usually appear in my lockfiles, because I'm running it interactively, rather than making it a dependency of my projects
