::: notes
this is intended to provide context on my priorities / habits of thought: 
- it needs to work across operating systems
- You can't depend on having pro features 
- avoid admin where possible 
- as portable as practical 
- audit context means I need to be able to reproduce exactly 
- "run this command" preferable to a confluence page of screenshots
:::

## How do I...

::: incremental
-   upgrade the version of R I'm using for this project?
-   know which package versions I'm using for this project?
-   move this project from one machine to another?
:::

::: notes
We're extending the lessons from Day 1 to think about what it means to work with R projects over time. That means that in addition to wanting our individual projects to flow smoothly, we also want to strategize about how to manage different versions of the language, different package versions, and different execution contexts. Working on an old project on a new computer is a lot like trying to put an app into production.

## why

![](img/slacking-tidyverse.png)

## types of R packages

-   Binary
-   Source

"packages have to be compiled to run"
the question is when
- show how to set options for different environment managers
- what does this look like in CI
- insufficiently motivated?
- you need the dev version of something

- ?Workflows break w/ current CRAN package, need to go back to older package
- Install package from github
- Develop your own packages
under: Make it explicit  why we care about installing from source

- binaries are probably faster 
- CRAN doesn't always have binaries available but you may not need them

## Binary

-   compiled ahead of time
-   only R is needed to install

## where to get binaries

|                                   |        CRAN        | RStudio Package Manager\* |
|------------------------|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| {{< fa brands windows >}} windows | :white_check_mark: |    :white_check_mark:     |
| {{< fa brands apple >}} mac OS    | :white_check_mark: |            :x:            |
| {{< fa brands linux >}} linux     |        :x:         |    :white_check_mark:     |

## Source

-   compiled in development environment
-   requires extra tools when package uses C, C++ or Fortran

::: notes
One additional complication for \*nix users: generally on windows can install and load packages that depend on other lower level libraries quite easily. Explain installing `sf`, for example.
:::

## if you don't have tools

- set context about installing from github

``` {.r code-line-numbers="11"}

## renv

![](img/renv.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
renv has a number of tools that are helpful for adopting a project-based workflow: - lockfile records what packages you use and where you instaled them from - `renv::install()` can handle installation from remote sources, local sources, package versions, bioconductor, rspm - per-project library isolation with global package cache makes it easy to install experimental versions of packages and then roll back to a stable release if it doesn't work out
:::

## `renv::init()`

``` {.r code-line-numbers="|2|4"}
.libPaths()
renv::init()
.libPaths()
renv::deactivate()
.libPaths()
```

why are we doing this?
- don't break your old dashboards
- where is this actually going
- talk more explicitly about the behavior of renv
- steal kevin's graphics on renv

::: {.notes}
run `.libPaths()` to see what your default package libraries are
initialize an renv--you'll see that the environment is now local to the project
note the .Rprofile that gets placed into your project, which runs an R script in `renv/activate.R`
deactivate the environment and check libPaths() again--it should be back to normal
:::


## `renv.lock`

``` json
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.1.2",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",

      ]
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

::: notes
created from `renv::snapshot()` by default, identifies dependencies of your code for example: usethis doesn't usually appear in my lockfiles, because I'm running it interactively, rather than making it a dependency of my projects
:::

a) create two projects

just use status messages rather than showing people lockfile

a) using renv, 
install.packages("renv")
install("jeroen/jsonlite")
install jsonlite from github
then install from CRAN to roll back

more explanation of global cache


then roll back to released version

b) restore the environment from an existing project
- an old one of yours from github
- create an environment for a tidyverse package

dtplyr renv example where across isn't implementeed

The best way to become more comfortable with installing things is to practice in an environment you can throw away  
- the windows sandbox lets you test in an environment on your machine that won't affect your computer 
- enabling it is outside the scope of this course

## package managers

software whose job it is to install other software


| Operating system | Recommended |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| {{< fa brands windows >}} windows        | **scoop**, chocolatey, winget |
| {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS            | **homebrew**                  |
| {{< fa brands linux >}} linux            | **homebrew**, apt, yum, zypper|

## :warning:

Avoid installing your language with a package manager

::: notes
You want to avoid having the language version your projects are using changed out from you unexpectedly
Tools for freezing installations with your package manager are not consistently effective
Other software that you install with your package manager may expect that package manager to be running the latest
Idiosyncracies of your language will be better understood by a dedicated tool

## language managers

using your package manager, install a language manager

::: panel-tabset
### windows

``` powershell
scoop install rig
```

### \*nix

``` bash
brew install rig
```
:::

<small> pyenv\
nvm\
</small>

::: notes
-   many language managers are often written in some language other than the one they are responsible for managing
:::

## language versions

using your language manager, install a language version:

``` shell
❯ rig install --help
rig-add

DESCRIPTION:
    Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
    It keeps the already installed R versions, except versions within the
    same minor branch, see below.

EXAMPLES:
    # Add the latest release
    rig add release

    # Install specific version
    rig add 4.1.2

    # Install latest version within a minor branch
    rig add 4.1
```

::: notes
if you're running a distribution of linux that rig doesn't support: - https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r/

if no pre-compiled binary of rig is available: - https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r-source/
:::

## environment managers

using your desired version of the language, install an environment manager:

``` r
install.packages("renv")
```

## project

using your environment manager, install your project's dependencies:

-   create a new environment

    ``` r
    renv::init()
    ```

-   restore a pre-defined environment

    ``` r
    renv::restore()
    ```
